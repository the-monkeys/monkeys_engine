# PR Approval and Merge

We are keeping some checks before merging the PRs to the main branch to maintain the code for a long time and for now we have setup the following rules, it future we may update the rules use some automation and pipeline for code and consistency checks.

* All the PRs need to be approved by [Dave Augustus](https://github.com/daveaugustus) before the merge.
* Code consistency needs to be checked before raising the PR.
* Spelling needs to be checked before the PR.
* The sensitive information like environment variables shouldn't be in the code.
* Linting needs to be checked.
